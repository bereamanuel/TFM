My TFM project about Numerical Methods for Stchocastic Differential Equations
This work addresses the fundamental theoretical foundations for implementing numerical methods applied to stochastic differential equations. It encompasses essential definitions of stochastic processes and conducts an in-depth examination of the Taylor--It√¥ theorem, employed as a tool for developing algorithms necessary for the numerical resolution of the posed problem. The scrutinized algorithms represent extensions of basic models of non-stochastic differential equations adapted to the stochastic domain. Lastly, a practical case is considered, applied to benchmark stock indices.
